# Lesson 1 notes

- We're be programming in a language called Python. It's widely used nowadays for everything from robotics to technology startup companies.
- Code is linear, executes from top to bottom

- Functions are like minecraft commands, to be executed. They execute one at a time.

```
print(5)
print(20)
```

- Variables store a value for later use, and can be numbers or strings (or other stuff we'll get to later). 

```
my_name = "Sean"
print(my_name)

my_favorite_number = 27
print(my_favorite_number)
```

- Variables have type. Let's demostrate with basic math, which we then print results

```
original_number = raw_input("Pick a number:")
original_number = int(original_number)

calc_number = original_number * 2
print(calc_number)

calc_number = calc_number * 5
print(calc_number)

calc_number = calc_number / original_number
print(calc_number)

calc_number = calc_number - 7
print(calc_number)
```

- The above is actually an algorithm, it always returns the number 3. What happens if we remove the casting to an int()?

Now let's do this together. Turn on your computers, and go to codecombat.com.
