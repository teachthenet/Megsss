#CHALLENGE 1
# Modify the script above, and instead of summoning a snowman on the arrow, summon a lightning bolt.
# You'll need to look at the link below to see what the entity name is for snowman.
# http://technical-minecraft.wikia.com/wiki/Entity

#CHALLENGE 2
# Instead of summoning an entity, let's change the block.
# Here's an example of how it would look to summon water at the location of the arrow:
# response=rcon.send("execute @e[type=Arrow] ~ ~ ~ setblock ~ ~ ~ minecraft:flowing_water")
# Using this link: http://minecraft-ids.grahamedgecombe.com/
# Experiment with summoning various other blocks at the location, such as flowing lava.
# Note that in this case, instead of using the block ID as you have before, you need to use the
# more "human" name (e.g. minecraft:flowing_water)
